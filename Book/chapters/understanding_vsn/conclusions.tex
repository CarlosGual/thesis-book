\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we offer a thorough experimental evaluation setup for the VSN problem based on the open-source pyRIL library and two navigation environments: Miniworld-Maze; and a 3D scanned scene from HM3D database using Habitat simulator.
Following this proposal, we offer a detailed analysis of a state-of-the-art VSN model based on a CLIP feature extractor and LSTMs encoders for the agent state, introducing also reward shaping and $\epsilon\text{-}greedy$ techniques.
Our results confirm the impact of these techniques in both environments. 
The models, data and codes are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/gramuah/vsn} to encourage much needed further research on VSN\@.
