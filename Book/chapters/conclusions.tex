\chapter{Conclusions}\label{ch:conclusions}

\lettrine{\textcolor{accent_color}{T}}{his} thesis has focused on the exploration of robotic visual navigation, specifically in the context of visual semantic navigation, and how it can be improved through the use of reinforcement learning methodologies.
The main objective has been to develop a new ROS~\cite{ros} framework that allows the integration of different algorithms and environments, as well as to explore new approaches to offline reinforcement learning and meta imitation learning for robotic visual navigation.
Concretely, the thesis has focused into solving \acrshort{objnav}
