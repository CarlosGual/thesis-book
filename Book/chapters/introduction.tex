\lettrine{\textcolor{accent_color}{W}}{ho} has never dreamt of a robot friend?
A robot that can help you with your daily tasks, play games with you, help you with your homework or even be your personal assistant.

The idea of having a robot friend is not new, for it has remained a dream for humanity for a long time.
In the past, this dream was only possible in science fiction movies and books.
However, with the recent advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence, this dream is becoming a reality.
