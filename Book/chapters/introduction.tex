\lettrine{\textcolor{accent_color}{W}}{ho} has never dreamt of a robot friend?
A robot that can help you with your daily tasks, play games with you, help you with your homework or even be your personal assistant?
The idea of having a robotic companion is not new, for it has remained a dream for humanity for a long time.
Since the first mention of the term \textit{robot}~\cite{robot1920}, this aspiration was only possible in science fiction movies and books.
However, with the recent advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence, we are closer than ever to this reality.
This humble thesis is nothing more than just a small step towards the joint effort of achieving this dream.

Now, how do we push forward the combined efforts of robotics and artificial intelligence to create a robot that can be a friend to humans?
This is were the multidisciplinary field of Embodied AI~\cite{Liu2024AligningCS} comes into play.
