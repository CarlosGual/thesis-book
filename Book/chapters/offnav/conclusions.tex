\subsection{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusions}

From the results obtained in the experiments, we can conclude that the proposed OffNav method is able to learn navigation policies effectively from human demonstrations.
It can also be seen that the method is able to generalize to unseen environments, as shown in setups 4 and 5, and outperform the state-of-the-art model PirlNav~\cite{ramrakhya2023} in the most challenging one.
Future work will focus on training the policy with more diverse environments to improve its generalization capabilities and further extend this analysis.
